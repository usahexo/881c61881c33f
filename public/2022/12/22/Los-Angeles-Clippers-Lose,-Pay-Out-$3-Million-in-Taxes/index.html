            <h1 id="Los-Angeles-Clippers-Lose-Pay-Out-3-Million-in-Taxes"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Clippers-Lose-Pay-Out-3-Million-in-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Clippers Lose, Pay Out $3 Million in Taxes"></a>Los Angeles Clippers Lose, Pay Out $3 Million in Taxes</h1><p>In what could be seen as an ironic turn of events, the Los Angeles Clippers paid out nearly $3 million in taxes this year. Despite making it to the playoffs and losing in the first round, their high salary players resulted in them owing a significant amount to the US government.</p>
<p>Blake Griffin, who is the team’s highest-paid player, made over $30 million this season. DeAndre Jordan, Chris Paul, and JJ Redick also had sizable salaries, resulting in the Clippers owing $2.98 million in taxes. This number is significantly higher than what most other teams owe. The Cleveland Cavaliers, for instance, only had to pay out $1.1 million in taxes despite making it to the Finals.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that teams whose players make less money tend to end up owing more money in taxes. For example, the Utah Jazz only had to pay out $562 thousand in taxes even though they had one of the best seasons in their franchise history. This is because NBA rules state that teams must pay a “luxury tax” if they have a payroll above a certain amount.</p>
<p>This rule was put into place several years ago in order to help keep small market teams competitive with larger ones. It has caused several high-profile teams to pay out millions of dollars in additional taxes over the years. The Clippers are just one example of this trend.</p>
<p>Despite being taxed so heavily, it’s unclear whether or not the Clippers will change their spending habits this offseason. They are still contenders in the Western Conference and have shown no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Nets-Pay-Out-Over-5-Million-in-Sports-Betting-Taxes"><a href="#New-Jersey-Nets-Pay-Out-Over-5-Million-in-Sports-Betting-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Nets Pay Out Over $5 Million in Sports Betting Taxes"></a>New Jersey Nets Pay Out Over $5 Million in Sports Betting Taxes</h1><p>The Nets organization became the latest sports team to contribute millions of dollars in taxes to the New Jersey state government from their sports betting operations.</p>
<p>In total, the Nets paid out over $5 million in taxes from their on-site and mobile sports betting operations during the month of January. The total amount of taxes paid out by all of New Jersey’s sports teams is now over $21 million since legal sports betting launched in the state last June.</p>
<p>This sizable contribution from the Nets is just another indication that regulated and taxed sports betting is a viable and successful industry in New Jersey. In fact, it was recently announced that the Meadowlands Racetrack will be expanding its gaming floor thanks to the success of its sportsbook.</p>
<p>Other states looking to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders would do well to take note of New Jersey’s success. The combination of a thriving industry and tax revenue for the state government makes for a winning recipe that is sure to be enticing to many legislators.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-Pay-Out-7-Million-in-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-Pay-Out-7-Million-in-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers Pay Out $7 Million in Taxes on Gambling Winnings"></a>Indiana Pacers Pay Out $7 Million in Taxes on Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers Basketball Club has paid over $7 million in taxes on gambling winnings in the past two years, new records from the Indiana Gaming Commission show.</p>
<p>The records, released earlier this week in response to a public records request from The Indianapolis Star, show that the Pacers paid $4.5 million in taxes on gambling winnings for the 2017 tax year and $2.5 million for the 2018 tax year.</p>
<p>Most of that money — $3.5 million in 2017 and $2.1 million in 2018 — came from payments on winnings at Indiana casinos. The team also paid federal income taxes on its gambling earnings, but those figures were not released by the Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>A total of 16 teams in the National Basketball Association reported paying out more than $100 million in combined taxes on gambling winnings between 2016 and 2018, according to figures compiled by The Star. </p>
<p>The Philadelphia 76ers led all NBA teams with $151 million in reported gambling income during that period, followed by the Cleveland Cavaliers ($146 million) and Golden State Warriors ($139 million).</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Lakers ($128 million) and Boston Celtics ($123 million) rounded out the top five. </p>
<p>The data shows just how much money is flowing through professional sports leagues and their teams from legal wagering across the United States. It also highlights the potential for even more tax revenue for government coffers if sports betting is legalized nationwide. </p>
<p>State and local governments could gain an estimated $2.3 billion annually if they taxed sports betting at a rate of 10 percent, according to a study last year by Oxford Economics. </p>
<p>That number would jump to $5 billion if all states participated and allowed betting on college as well as professional games, said study author John Warren Kindt, a professor of business and legal policy at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p>
<p> Gambling has become a big business for professional sports leagues and their teams in recent years. And with legalized sports betting spreading throughout the country, that trend is only expected to continue growing. </p>
<p>A study last year by Oxford Economics estimated that state and local governments could gain an annual windfall of $2.3 billion if they taxed sports betting at a rate of 10 percent. That number would jump to $5 billion if all states participated and allowed betting on college as well as professional games, said study author John Warren Kindt, a professor of business and legal policy at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that teams are looking to get their cut of what is now a multi-billion dollar industry. The Philadelphia 76ers led all NBA teams with $151 million in reported gambling income between 2016 and 2018, according to figures compiled by The Indianapolis Star. They were followed closely by the Cleveland Cavaliers ($146 million) and Golden State Warriors ($139 million). </p>
<p>The Los Angeles Lakers ($128 million) and Boston Celtics ($123 million) rounded out the top five. But nearly every team in the NBA has reported some level of gambling income during that time period — with 16 teams paying out more than $100 million cumulatively in taxes over those three years. </p>
<p> With so much money flowing through professional sports leagues and their franchises, it’s no wonder that team owners are pushing for legalization of sports betting nationwide. They stand to make a lot of money off this industry – not just from bets placed with their own businesses but also from taxes levied on those wagers</p>
<h1 id="Charlotte-Bobcats-Paid-Out-Nearly-1-5-Million-in-Sports-Betting-Taxes"><a href="#Charlotte-Bobcats-Paid-Out-Nearly-1-5-Million-in-Sports-Betting-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Charlotte Bobcats Paid Out Nearly $1.5 Million in Sports Betting Taxes"></a>Charlotte Bobcats Paid Out Nearly $1.5 Million in Sports Betting Taxes</h1><p>The Charlotte Bobcats accounted for nearly $1.5 million in sports betting taxes during the 2013 fiscal year, according to figures released this week by the North Carolina Secretary of State.</p>
<p>The Bobcats, who play their home games at the Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, generated a total of $2,039,804 in sports betting tax revenue during the fiscal year that ended June 30th. Of that amount, $1,465,711 was generated from bets placed on NBA games.</p>
<p>The remaining $574,093 came from bets placed on collegiate and other professional sporting events. The Bobcats are one of four teams in the NBA’s Southeast Division.</p>
<p>The Miami Heat topped all NBA teams with $4.5 million in sports betting tax revenue for the 2013 fiscal year. That was followed by the Dallas Mavericks ($3.6 million), Houston Rockets ($3.4 million) and San Antonio Spurs ($3.2 million).</p>
<p>The Atlanta Hawks ($2.5 million) and Orlando Magic ($1.8 million) rounded out the top five teams in terms of sports betting tax revenue generated in 2013. The Memphis Grizzlies were sixth with $1.7 million.</p>
<p>In total,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> North Carolina raked in nearly $30 million in sports betting tax revenue during the 2013 fiscal year. That was up from the $27 million collected in 2012 and the $23 million collected in 2011.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Pistons-Paid-Over-1-8-Million-in-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Detroit-Pistons-Paid-Over-1-8-Million-in-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Pistons Paid Over $1.8 Million in Taxes on Gambling Winnings"></a>Detroit Pistons Paid Over $1.8 Million in Taxes on Gambling Winnings</h1><p>In a move that is sure to surprise many in the state of Michigan, it has been revealed that the Detroit Pistons organization paid over $1.8 million in taxes on gambling winnings for the 2018 tax year. This figure was released by the team in a letter to season ticket holders, and comes as a result of the legalization of gambling in the state.</p>
<p>The Pistons organization did not provide any specific details on which type of gambling generated the winnings, though it is presumed that most, if not all, of it came from bets on professional basketball games. In addition to the taxes paid, the team also noted that it had incurred significant expenses related to betting operations, including marketing and advertising costs.</p>
<p>This news is surprising in light of the fact that other professional sports teams in Michigan have seen their gambling-related income go largely untaxed. The Detroit Lions, for example, only paid $10,000 in taxes on their gambling income last year. It’s unclear why the Pistons were singled out for this tax bill, though team officials say they are not opposed to paying their fair share.</p>
<p>Michigan’s new gambling laws went into effect at the beginning of 2018, and since then there has been a rush by casinos and other gaming establishments to get up and running. In particular, sports betting has become increasingly popular, with more than half of all Americans now wagering on sporting events at some point during the year.</p>
<p>This growth is expected to continue in 2019 and beyond, as more states legalize gambling and additional casinos open up across the country. The Pistons organization clearly sees this as an opportunity to generate additional revenue, and it will be interesting to see if other teams in Michigan follow suit and begin paying taxes on their gambling income.</p>
