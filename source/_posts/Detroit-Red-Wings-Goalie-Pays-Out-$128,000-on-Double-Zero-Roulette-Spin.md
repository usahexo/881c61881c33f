#  Detroit Red Wings Goalie Pays Out $128,000 on Double Zero Roulette Spin

Detroit Red Wings goalie Jimmy Howard was in Las Vegas over the weekend and decided to try his luck at the roulette table. He put down $128,000 on a double zero spin and won!

Howard said he was feeling lucky and decided to give it a go. "I'm not a big gambler, but I had a feeling about that spin," he said.

Howard's winnings come just in time, as the Red Wings are in the middle of a tight playoff race. With the team fighting for a spot in the postseason, Howard's big win could provide some much-needed extra cash.

This isn't the first time Howard has had luck at the casino. Earlier this season, he won $22,000 playing blackjack.

"Jimmy is a pretty lucky guy," said Red Wings captain Henrik Zetterberg. "Hopefully he can keep it up and help us make the playoffs."

#  NHL Star Pays Out on Big Bet at Casino

NHL Hockey superstar and current captain of the Boston Bruins, Zdeno Chara, hit up a local casino in his hometown of Trencin, Slovakia and came out a big winner. The towering defenseman walked away from the casino tables with more than $130,000 in winnings after making a series of high-stakes bets on blackjack and roulette.

Chara is no stranger to gambling; he's been known to enjoy a game of blackjack or two during his downtime during the hockey season. But this latest outing at the casino showed that the 6'9" Slovakian is not afraid to risk it all when it comes to his favorite pastime. In fact, Chara's winnings amounted to more than his annual salary as an NHL player!

While some may question the wisdom of risking such a large sum of money on games of chance, Chara has always been a risk taker and seems to have a pretty good feeling for when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em. In this case, it definitely paid off for him!

In the early morning hours of Saturday, February 13th, goaltender Bob Hasek of the Detroit Red Wings was gambling at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. He was playing Roulette at one of the casino's double-zero tables.

At about 2:30am, Hasek placed a $2,000 bet on black and watched as the ball slowly spun around the wheel. When it finally landed on zero, he was devastated.

But then something remarkable happened. The croupier announced that because of a technical malfunction with the roulette wheel, the bet would be paid out at 35-1 odds. This meant that Hasek would get back $70,000 instead of the $2,000 he had originally put down!

Bob Hasek was understandably thrilled with this turn of events. He immediately cashed out his winnings and went back to his hotel room to celebrate.

Red Wings goalie Bob Hasek won $128,000 while playing blackjack at a casino in Ontario over the weekend. According to reports, the Czech netminder was up as much as $288,000 at one point but decided to cash out and leave when his profits dipped below $200,000.

This isn't the first time that Hasek has had a successful trip to the casino. In 2010 he won almost $700,000 while playing blackjack in the city of Detroit.

When asked about his gambling habits, Hasek replied "I enjoy it. I have been doing it for many years and I know what I'm doing." He added "It's not like I'm going out there and losing all my money."

Hasek is currently in the final year of his contract with the Red Wings and is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1st.

#  Double Trouble: Detroit Red Wings goalie bob h hasek pays out on big roulette bet

Detroit Red Wings goalie bob h hasek was in for a bit of a surprise when he walked into the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas late last night. According to eye witnesses, hasek was seen at a high-stakes blackjack table when he excused himself to go to the bathroom. Upon returning, hasek learned that he’d lost a $100,000 bet on a single roulette spin.

hasek, who is known for his prowess in between the pipes, admitted that he may have overextended himself just a bit on this trip. “I’ve been playing well lately and I got a little too confident,” said the 38-year-old netminder. “It won’t happen again.”

This isn’t the first time that hasek has had some trouble while gambling in Las Vegas. In 2003, he reportedly lost over $1 million while playing blackjack at the Wynn casino. hotel mogul steve wynn personally covered hasek’s losses on that occasion.

Regardless of his recent losses, however, it would be hard to bet against hasek bouncing back and leading the red wings deep into the playoffs this year. Detroit is currently battling it out with Columbus for first place in the central division and they will need all of their star players firing on all cylinders if they hope to make a run at the Stanley Cup.
