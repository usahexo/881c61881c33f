#  Why Does a Blackjack Dealer Have to Stiff Brigitte Bardot?

*Blackjack dealers have to stiff Brigitte Bardot because they are not allowed to take any hits on their 17 hand.*

If a blackjack dealer has a 17 hand, they are not allowed to take any more cards in order to try and improve their hand. This is because the dealer is playing against all of the other players at the table, and they don’t want the dealer to have an advantage over them.

This rule can often lead to some interesting situations at the blackjack table. For example, if a player has a hand of 17, they may be tempted to ask the dealer for another card in order to try and improve their hand. However, if the dealer also has a 17 hand, they will have to refuse this request.

This rule can also lead to some big swings in the game. For example, let’s say that there are two players left in the game – Player A and Dealer – and each player has a hand of 17. If Player A decides to hit on their hand, then they could potentially win the game if they get a lucky card. However, if Dealer also hits on their hand, then both players will end up with busted hands and the game will be over.

So why does a blackjack dealer have to stiff Brigitte Bardot? It all comes down to giving the other players at the table as fair of a chance as possible.

#  Dealer's Duty: Why Inflicting a Bust on Brigitte Bardot is Essential

Dealers across the country are up in arms about the proposed bann on Brigitte Bardot. "It's a travesty!" cries one, who wishes to remain anonymous. "She's a national treasure, and her art is invaluable! We can't let this happen!"

The dealers are right - we can't let this happen. Why? Because banning Bardot would be an assault on our freedoms.

Think about it: what would stop the government from banning any other artist they don't agree with? What's to stop them from banning Beethoven next, or Rembrandt, or Shakespeare? There's nothing to stop them - unless we stand up and fight for our rights.

And that's why it's so important to support Brigitte Bardot. She's a symbol of freedom, of artistic expression, and of democracy. She's a fighter, and she deserves our support.

So please, sign the petition to keep Brigitte Bardot free! Let your voice be heard! Thank you.

#  Blackjack Dealer Defends Decision to Stiff Brigitte Bardot

The blackjack dealer at the casino in Monaco who refused to deal cards to Brigitte Bardot says he had no regrets about his decision, despite the criticism he has since received.

“She was being incredibly rude and disruptive,” said the dealer, who asked not to be identified. “She was yelling at the other players and cursing at me. I didn’t want her ruining the game for everyone else.”

Bardot has denied that she was out of line, telling reporters that she was merely trying to get the dealer to pay attention to her.

“I just wanted him to deal me a hand, but he ignored me completely,” said Bardot. “I have never been treated so poorly in my life.”

The dealer said he was only following guidelines from the casino management when he refused to deal cards to Bardot.

“We were told not to deal cards to anyone who is being disruptive or creating a disturbance,” he said. “And that is exactly what she was doing.”

#  Brigitte Bardot Speaks Out Against Brutal Blackjack Dealer

Brigitte Bardot, 83, is a French actress, singer and animal rights activist. She has been outspoken against the horrific treatment of animals in circuses and zoos.

Until now she had remained silent about the brutal blackjack dealers at the casino near her home in Saint-tropez. "I was appalled when I saw how they were treating the animals," Bardot said in an interview with Paris Match. "The poor creatures were being terrorized by those heartless dealers."

She went on to say that she plans to file a complaint with the authorities. "This is unacceptable behavior and I intend to see that these dealers are punished for their actions."

When asked her opinion about the new smoking ban in France, Bardot had this to say: "I'm all for it! It's about time something was done to protect the health of the people of France."

#  Blackjack Dealer labeled a villain for stiffing Brigitte Bardot

A blackjack dealer has been labeled a villain by the French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot for allegedly stiffing her at a casino.

The 74-year-old starlet said she was left "dry as a bone" after the dealer failed to pay out on a winning hand worth €11,000 (£9,600, $12,500) during a game at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in Monaco.

According to reports in the French media, Bardot was playing blackjack with two friends when she hit a royal flush – the best possible hand in the game.

However, the dealer refused to pay out and accused Bardot of cheating. The dispute resulted in the casino confiscating her winnings.

Bardot has since blasted the dealer as a "villain" and called on the casino to sack her.

"I can't believe it. I thought I was dreaming," Bardot told journalists at a press conference on Wednesday. "This woman has no heart."
