#  Simpsons Tapped Out: How to Play in Burns Casino

Casinos have been around for centuries, providing a place for people to gamble and have some fun. The Simpsons tapped out has its own casino, which was added in the most recent update. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to play in the Burns casino, what games are available and what you can win.

The Burns casino is open from Monday to Friday, between the hours of 4pm and midnight. You can access it by tapping on the casino door at the back of Springfield. There are three game rooms in the Burns casino - a slots room, a blackjack room and a roulette room.

To play in the Burns casino, you need chips. These can be earned by completing tasks or bought with donuts. You start with 5000 chips and can hold up to 1 million chips at any one time. All of the games in the casino require chips to play.

The slots room has six machines, each with different prizes. The higher the prize, the harder it is to win. To play, select your bet amount (10-200 chips) and hit spin. If three matching symbols appear on the payline, you win that prize.

The blackjack room has four tables - double diamond, european blackjack, perfect pairs and red dog poker. The table limits range from 1-500 chips and the payout percentages are posted next to each table. To play blackjack, first choose your bet amount (10-200 chips) then hit deal. Your cards will be dealt face up and you must decide whether to hit (draw another card), stand (stick with your current cards), double down (double your bet and receive one more card) or split (separate two cards of equal value into two hands). The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21 points.

The roulette room has a limit of 500 chips per bet and employs standard European rules - red/black, odd/even and high/low bets are all available as well as individual numbers bets. To play roulette, choose your chip denomination (1-500) then place your bets on either the inside or outside of the wheel. Once all players have placed their bets, press spin to see where the ball ends up landing.
