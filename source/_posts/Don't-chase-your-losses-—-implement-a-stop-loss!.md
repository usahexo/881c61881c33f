#  Don't chase your losses — implement a stop loss!

Most people who trade stocks, forex, or any other form of investment, do so in the hopes of making a profit. Unfortunately, even with the best research and planning, there is no guarantee that you will make money on any given trade. This can lead to a feeling of frustration when you experience a losing streak, eventually causing some traders to abandon their strategy in search of something that works better.

The reality is that losses are an inevitable part of trading, and if you don't have a plan for dealing with them you will likely end up losing more money in the long run. One of the most important tools for managing risk is a stop loss order, which allows you to automatically sell (or buy) shares at a pre-determined price.

A stop loss order is setup by specifying the stock or currency pair you are buying/selling, the amount you want to invest, and the price at which you would like to close your position. For example, if I am long 100 shares of AAPL at $100 per share and wanted to use a stop loss order I could enter: "sell 100 AAPL at $97". If AAPL falls below $97 per share my position would be automatically closed and I would lose only $3 per share (minus any commission fees).

There are two main reasons why using a stop loss order is a smart idea: first, it helps you manage your risk by automatically closing your position if it falls too far; secondly, it can help keep you from chasing your losses by selling out of a bad position early.

It's important to note that not all stocks or currencies pairs have liquid markets that support stop loss orders. In these cases it may be necessary to use a mental stop instead. A mental stop is simply an agreement with yourself to sell (or buy) at a certain price point regardless of what the market is doing. For example, if I'm long EUR/USD at 1.4000 and it starts moving against me I might decide to place a mental stop at 1.3900 so that I don't lose too much money on the trade.

No matter what type of trader you are, using a stop loss order is always a good idea. It's one of the simplest ways to protect your capital and help ensure that your trading account stays in profit

#  How to limit your gambling losses and keep your sanity

If you're gambling, it's probably because you enjoy it. But like with most things in life, too much of a good thing can be bad. Too much gambling can lead to big losses and serious financial problems. So how can you limit your gambling losses and keep your sanity?

Here are a few tips:

1. Set a budget and stick to it

When you're gambling, it's easy to lose track of how much money you're spending. Make sure you set a budget and stick to it. Decide how much money you're willing to lose and when you reach that limit, stop gambling.

2. Only gamble with money you can afford to lose

Don't gamble with money you need for rent or bills. Gamble with money you can afford to lose – money that won't impact your day-to-day life if you lose it.

3. Take breaks from gambling

Gambling can be addictive, so make sure you take regular breaks from it. If you're feeling like you can't control yourself, take a break for a week or two. You'll probably come back refreshed and better able to control your spending.

4. Set win/loss limits

Decide before you start gambling how much money you're willing to win or lose on any given day, week or month. This will help keep your losses in check.

#  Turn the tables on casino gambling: how to make money not lose it

There’s a reason casinos are so popular: for many people, gambling is an adrenaline rush that can be hard to resist. But what if you could have that same thrill without risking your hard-earned money? Believe it or not, there are some ways to gamble that can actually make you money – and we’re not just talking about the slots.

# Blackjack

Blackjack may seem like one of the simplest casino games around, but it can also be one of the most profitable. For starters, always play with perfect strategy – that means knowing when to hit or stand, and when to double down or split. Additionally, try to find a table with favorable odds; for example, downtown Las Vegas casinos usually offer better blackjack bonuses than their strip counterparts.

# Craps

Craps may seem like an intimidating game, but with a little practice you can easily become a pro. The key to winning at craps is to bet on the right numbers; for example, place your chips on the “pass line” or “don’t pass” bets for the best chance of winning. Another important thing to remember is never to make prop bets – these are sucker bets that almost always result in a loss.

# Roulette

Roulette may be one of the oldest casino games around, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t still lucrative. To increase your chances of winning, avoid betting on red or black (the odds are even), and focus on outside bets instead (e.g. odd/even, high/low). You can also hedge your bets by placing multiple chips on different numbers – this way, if one number doesn’t come up you still have a chance at winning.

# Poker

Poker is another casino game where skill is more important than luck. If you want to make money playing poker, start by practicing online – this will give you a better understanding of the game mechanics and help improve your poker skills. When you feel confident enough, start playing in low-limit cash games – this is where the real money is made. And remember: patience is key! Don’t go all-in every hand; wait for good opportunities before committing your chips.

#  When to walk away from the table: tips for managing your gambling money

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it’s important to remember that you can also lose money. If you’re not careful, you might find yourself out of money and on the losing end of a gamble. Here are a few tips for managing your gambling money:

* Know when to walk away from the table. If you’re on a losing streak, it might be time to walk away from the table. There’s no shame in admitting defeat and walking away before you lose any more money.

* Set limits for yourself and stick to them. Decide how much money you’re willing to gamble with and don’t exceed that amount. If you find yourself losing too much money, stop gambling and walk away from the table.

* Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose. Gambling should be considered a recreational activity, not a way to make money. Don’t spend more money than you can afford to lose, and always have enough money set aside for emergencies.

* Gamble responsibly. Gambling shouldn’t interfere with your daily life or responsibilities. Make sure you have enough time to gamble responsibly without putting too much stress on yourself or your family.

If you follow these tips, you can help ensure that your gambling experience is enjoyable and financially responsible.

#  Set limits on your gambling expenditure and stick to them

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it’s important to set limits on your expenditure and stick to them. If you find yourself consistently spending more money than you intended, it might be time to take a break from gambling altogether.

There are a few ways to keep your gambling budget in check. One is to only gamble with money you can afford to lose. This means not using money earmarked for bills, rent or groceries. Another option is to set a limit on how much you’re willing to spend in a day, week or month.

Whatever method you choose, it’s important to be consistent and stay within your budget. Otherwise, you might find yourself in serious financial difficulty. Gambling can be addictive and before you know it, you might have blown your budget and racked up huge debts.

So if you want to continue gambling, be sure to set limits on your spending and stick to them. That way, you can enjoy the game without putting your finances at risk.
