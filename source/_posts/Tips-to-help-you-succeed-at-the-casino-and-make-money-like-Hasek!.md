They didn’t squander their hard-earned money on reckless bets; instead, they focused on making smart, strategic wagers that gave them the best chance of winning. Secondly, both Hasek and Jordan were extremely competitive individuals who always played to win.

But because they were so confident in their abilities, they were willing to take these risks and reap the rewards.

Lastly, both Hasek and Jordan were highly adaptable players who could change their game plan as needed. When one particular strategy wasn’t working, they weren’t afraid to abandon it and try something new.

2014 World Series of Poker Champion Martin Jacobson credits Dominik Hasek with helping him win his title, saying that the Czech goalie taught him how to keep his cool under pressure. Here are some of the tips that Hask has shared over the years about how to become a successful casino gambler:

* Stay calm and don't let emotions get in the way - This is probably one of the most important things that Dominik Hasek has learned throughout his career as a professional casino gambler. In any form of gambling, it's important to stay calm and rational so that you can make clear decisions based on sound judgment. When you start letting your emotions take control, you're more likely to make bad bets and lose money. As Dominik says, "In poker I'm trying to be cold like ice so my opponent will make mistakes."
* know your game inside out - It's important to be familiar with all aspects of the game you're playing if you want to be successful at casino gambling. This includes knowing the different betting options available as well as the odds of winning each hand or round. You should also have a solid strategy in place and be prepared to change it up depending on what your opponents are doing. 

* Have patience - This goes hand in hand with knowing your game inside out; if you're not patient, you'll be more likely to make rash decisions which can lead to losses. Casino gambling is a long-term game, so it's important to be able to wait for the right opportunity rather than going all in every time. 

* Stay discipline - Just like any other form of gambling, casino gambling can be addictive if you're not careful. It's important to set limits for yourself and stick to them; whether it's how much money you're willing to spend or how many hours you're going to play each day/week etc., having boundaries will help keep you in check.
