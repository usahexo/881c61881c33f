#  What is Craps? - The Basics of This Popular Gambling Game

Craps is one of the most popular casino gambling games in the world. Invented in the early 1800s, craps has a long and colorful history. Despite its complexity, the game is easy to learn and play.

In craps, players bet on the outcome of a dice roll. The game is played with two dice, and there are a variety of bets that players can make. The payout for each bet depends on the odds of that particular bet winning.

The basic rules of craps are as follows:

1. Players must place their bets before the first throw of the dice.
2. A player can either bet on the "Pass" or "Don't Pass" line.
3. The shooter (the person throwing the dice) must roll both dice at once and achieve a total number between 2 and 12.
4. If the total number is 7 or 11, this is called a "natural" and the player either wins or pushes (ties) their bet.
5. If the total number is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, this is called a "point." The point number is then kept until it is either repeated (called rolling "ins") or another number (7) is thrown which ends the round (called rolling "out").
6. If a point is rolled before a 7, players holding bets on that point win; if a 7 comes up first, players holding bets on that number lose

#  How to Play Craps - A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners

Craps can seem like a difficult game to understand and play, but with a little instruction it can be easy to learn the basics. This guide will provide you with everything you need to get started playing craps, including explanations of the game’s rules and how to make various bets.

# The Table

The craps table is a semi-circle with a “layout” of betting areas displayed on it. The table’s center is marked with a “boxman” and two dealers who are responsible for handling the dice and paying out winning bets. Players place their bets on the layout around the perimeter of the table.

# The Dice

Craps uses two six-sided dice that are shaken together and rolled across the table. Bettors can bet on what number will come up on the roll (the point), or they can bet that the dice will produce certain combinations (number pairs, etc.).

# The Bets

There are many different types of bets that can be made in craps, but some of the most common ones include pass line bets, come bets, place bets, proposition bets, and odds bets. We will go over each of these betting options in more detail below.

# Pass Line Bet

The pass line bet is one of the simplest wagers in craps. It is made on the come out roll (the first roll of the dice) and pays even money if a 7 or 11 is rolled, or loses if a 2, 3, or 12 is hit. If the shooter rolls any other number (the point), then players can make further wagers called odds bets on whether or not that number will be hit again before a 7 is rolled.






	 	  So now that you understand all there is to know about Craps let's take a look at how you actually play this interesting game!

  To begin playing Craps you obviously need to find yourself at a Craps Table; fortunately they're pretty common inside casinos although they're also starting to pop up in other places too such as online gambling sites - so wherever you may choose to gamble , there's likely gonna be one handy vicinity . Once you've found your Craps Table seats are open for business ! Just look for an open spot along the semicircular railing around the gaming surface - usually right next to where all those pretty multi-colored chips lay in wait .  In front of every player at the Craps Table there'll be a couple betting layouts as well laid out perpendicularly - one for Don't Pass and Come Wagers ; and another for Place Bets which we'll discuss later . The person throwing (or rolling ) the dice is called The Shooter - this title rotates around clockwise at every new round .Now once everyone has had ample time studying those layouts - it's finally time to start placing actual wagers !   So how do we do that ?

  As mentioned , there are numerous types of wagers available when playing Craps however probably 90%+ of all players tend to stick with just three basic ones : Pass Line , Don't Pass & Come . Let's take a closer look at each starting with Pass Line :   A Pass Line Bet is placed before any other bettors have had their turn thus becoming what's called an "offshore" wager - meaning it's being put down prior to anything else on that particular round . Players making this wager are essentially betting against 7 coming up BEFORE their chosen Point number does - which we'll get into more detail later . If (as we hope ) said Point eventually gets established then subsequent rolls will have added excitement as gamblers place further Wagers on whether that Point will be repeated again BEFORE getting doublesided by Sevens . Winnings from Pass Line Bet vary as payout odds change with casino house edge percentage but typically run around 1:1 payout minus commission taken , so for every $10 wagered expect about $11 back . Pretty simple !

Don't Pass Betting works inversely opposite from Pass Line Wagering ; so in short players here are rooting FOR 7 coming up BEFORE their chosen Point does . Obviously if this happens then they lose their bet amount - but if by some chance their Point eventually comes up then plays still collecting at 1:1 minus commission just as with P&L Bettors . Just like its counterpart ; Dont'Pass Wagering takes place prior to any other gambler getting their turn meaning it too becomes an "offshore" type wager ..

Both P&L Bets offer very simple gameplay while containing considerably less risk when compared side-by-side against other Craps possibilities such as Proposition Bets which have House Edge percentages reaching anywhere upwards to 16% ! Although we don't recommend staying away from Prop Bets altogether by any means - just bear in mind they should generally only be inserted into
