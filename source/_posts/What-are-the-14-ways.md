#  How do you look good in a coat?

There are a few things you can do to look great in a coat:

- Choose the right style: Not all coats are created equal! Choose the style that best suits your body shape. For example, if you have a big bust, choose a coat with a V-neck or lapels that will help to accentuate your chest. If you’re short, choose a coat with a hem that falls below your knee.

- Find the right fit: A coat that fits well will make you look polished and put together. Make sure the sleeves aren’t too long or too short, and that the waist isn’t too tight or too loose.

- Pay attention to color: Coats come in all different colors, so choose one that flatters your skin tone. If you have pale skin, go for a light color like beige or cream. If you have dark skin, go for a richer color like burgundy or navy.

- Accessorize: Adding accessories can take your look from drab to fab! Try adding a scarf, hat, or gloves to complete your outfit.

#  What is the goal of this guide?

The goal of this guide is to provide you with an understanding of the basics of blockchain technology and its potential applications.

# What is blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. It was first introduced by Bitcoin in 2008, as a way to track and record all Bitcoin transactions.

# How does blockchain work?

To understand how blockchain works, let's take a look at an example transaction. Stephanie wants to send one bitcoin to John. The transaction will be recorded on a public ledger, allowing anyone to view it. Here's how the process works:

1. Stephanie creates a new block on the blockchain, containing her bitcoin transaction information.
2. This block is then broadcast to all of the other nodes on the network.
3. Nodes validate the block, making sure that it follows all of the rules of the blockchain protocol. 
4. Once the block is validated, it is added to the chain, creating a permanent record of the transaction. 
5. John can now access his bitcoin and use it however he sees fit.

# What are some potential applications of blockchain technology?

There are many potential applications for blockchain technology, including: 
- cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum  - supply chain tracking  - voting verification  - file sharing  - medical record tracking
