# Trump Taj Mahal Casino Adds Rabona Football Game

The Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City has announced it will add a new football game to its repertoire - the rabona. The game, which is named for the Italian word for "leg", is a move that sees a player kick the ball around their thigh and then quickly flick it behind their leg with the kicking foot to send it on its way.

"We're very excited to add the rabona to our casino," said casino spokesperson Crystal Whitaker. "It's already proven to be a big hit with our guests."

The rabona has been around for centuries, but has only gained popularity in recent years. The move has been featured in popular video games such as FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer, and was made famous by Argentine football star Lionel Messi.

The Taj Mahal Casino is the first casino in Atlantic City to offer the game.

#  Caesars Atlantic City Adds A Rabona Sports Book

When walking into the Caesars sports book, you are immediately hit with the excitement of the games that are being played.

The Rabona is a type of soccer bet that is named after an infamous kick. The player kicks the ball towards the goal with their feet crossed, trapping the ball between their calves before kicking it - resembling a rabbit hopping away. This type of kick is rarely used in professional soccer games, making it a risky but potentially lucrative bet for those willing to take a chance.

#  Bally's Atlantic City to Feature Rabona Football

Atlantic City, New Jersey – September 5, 2017 – The new Bally's Atlantic City will feature Rabona Football, the world's first and only professional sport played with your feet.

Rabona Football is a new, fast-paced team sport that is easy to learn and exciting to watch. It is played on a rectangular field with two goals at each end. The object of the game is to score more goals than your opponent.

Rabona Football is similar to soccer, but there are some key differences. In Rabona Football, the players use their feet to pass and shoot the ball. There is no hand-eye coordination required, making it easy for anyone to play. Plus, there is no offside rule so players can move freely up and down the field.

"We are excited to introduce Rabona Football to Atlantic City," said Tony Rodio, President and CEO of Caesars Entertainment Atlantic City. "This new sport is perfect for our guests who are looking for a fun and exciting way to get active."

The new Bally's Atlantic City will feature a 4,000-square-foot Rabona Football arena where guests can watch games or participate in clinics taught by professional players. There will also be a retail store where guests can purchase equipment and apparel.

#  Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa Starts Offering Rabona Football 

The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa announced that they will be starting to offer the rabona football. The new game has been a big hit in Europe and South America, and the casino is hoping that it will be just as popular in the United States. The rabona football is a simple game to play, but it can be very exciting.

The game is played with two teams of five players each. There are also three referees on the field. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team. The players can use their feet, head, or any part of their bodies except their hands to score goals.

The rules of rabona football are pretty simple. The first team to score seven goals wins the game. If the game is tied after seven goals have been scored, then an extra time period will be played. If the game is still tied after the extra time period, then a shootout will be used to determine the winner.

The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa plans to offer rabona football tournaments for both adults and children. They are also planning on having a league where players can compete against one another for prizes.
