#  Maya 2016 how to make the slot machine Eliot

In this tutorial we will explore how to create the slot machine in Maya 2016.

There are three main steps required to create the slot machine:

1. Create the basic geometry for the machine.
2. Add UVs and texturing. 
3. Set up the animation.

We will look at each of these steps in more detail below.

1. Create the basic geometry for the machine.

The first step is to create the basic geometry for the machine. This includes a base, sides, back and front panels, a coin drawer, and a handle. You can use any polygonal modelling technique you like to create these shapes. I have created mine using polygon modelling in Maya 2016 but you could also use subdivision surfaces or even a combination of both techniques.

Here is my basic geometry for the machine:
























As you can see, I have used polygon modelling to create all of the shapes needed for the machine. The only exception is the coin drawer which I have created using subdivision surfaces). The key thing here is to make sure that your geometry is clean and accurate, especially when it comes to creating curves and angles accurately. This will help ensure that your final model looks accurate and consistent. For instance, notice how I have angled the edges of some of the polygons on the front panel so that they match the angle of the real-world machine accurately:







      This attention to detail will be important later on when we start adding UVs and textures to our model.

2. Add UVs and texturing.

Now that we have our basic geometry created, we need to add UVs so that we can texture it correctly. Again, there are many ways to do this but I will show you how I did it in Maya 2016 using Unfold 3D: 
              1) Go to Window > Rendering Editors > Unfold 3D . This will open up the Unfold 3D window:
              2) Select all of your geometry in Object mode (select all by pressing A ) then go to Edit > Copy Special > Unfold 3D Coordinates . This will copy all of your UVs into Unfold 3D:
              ​3) In Unfold 3D, click on the Paint tab at the top:
              4) Make sure that Use Texture is selected then click on Load Texture :
          5) Navigate to where your texture image is stored and select it:
          6) Click on OK then press F6 to render your scene:
          As you can see, my UVs are now correctly aligned with my geometry:

#  New Maya 2016 Tutorial: How to make the slot machine Eliot

In this Maya 2016 tutorial, we will create a slot machine. This simple tutorial will show you how to create the basic slot machine mesh, animate it, and apply a materials.

First we need to create the mesh for our slot machine. This is pretty simple, we just need a few cylinders and a cube.

To start, create a new Maya document and delete the default cube. Next, create three cylinders; one for the body of the machine, one for the lever, and one for the coin tray.

For the body of the machine, I used a cylinder with a radius of 1’ and a height of 6’. For the lever I used a cylinder with a radius of .5’ and a height of 2’. And for the coin tray I used a cube with a dimension of 6”x6”x6”.

Now that we have our mesh created, we can start animating it. In Maya 2016 there are two new ways to animate objects, brush based animation and node based animation. In this tutorial we will be using brush based animation.

To animate our slot machine we need to create what is called an animated curve. An animated curve is simply a curve that animates or changes over time. To create an animated curve in Maya 2016 you can use either the graph editor or Dope Sheet editor. We will be using the Dope Sheet editor in this tutorial.

To create an animated curve in the Dope Sheet editor select your object and open up the Dope Sheet editor window (Window>Dope Sheet). Next go to Animation>Create Keyframe Animation and select your object(s). This will create an animated curve for your object(s) in the Dope Sheet editor window.



























To animate our lever we just need to move it up and down over time. To do this we need to add keyframes to our animated curve in the Dope Sheet editor window. To add keyframes click on frame 1 in the timeline and then move your lever up (I moved mine up to about frame 80). Next click on frame 80 and move your lever down (I moved mine down to about frame 160). This will add keyframes to our animated curve telling Maya 2016 that at frame 1 our lever is up and at frame 80 our lever is down. You can now play back your animation by clicking on Play button in the toolbar or pressing Alt+A on your keyboard.

#  Make the Slot Machine Eliot in Maya 2016

In this tutorial we will be creating a Slot Machine using Maya 2016. This tutorial is geared more towards those with some basic knowledge of Maya, but beginners should be able to follow along with some patience.

First, we will create the cylindrical shape that will make up the body of our Slot Machine. To do this, create a new polygonal cube and delete the top two polygons so that it is shaped like a cylinder. In the Channel Box, rename the cube "Cylinder". With the Cylinder selected, go to the Mesh tab and set its Subdivision Level to 3. This will give us a smoother surface for our Slot Machine.

With the Cylinder still selected, click on the Coordinates icon in the toolbar (the green box with three dots). In the Attributes Manager that pops up, change X Rotation to -90 degrees and Y Rotation to 45 degrees. This will rotate our Cylinder so that it is standing on its end.

Now we will create the body of our Slot Machine. Duplicate the Cylinder twice and move them into position so that they form a triangular prism (see image below). Rename the first copy "Top" and the second copy "Bottom". In the Channel Box, set Bottom's Subdivision Level to 2 while leaving Top at 3. This will give us a nicer surface on Bottom while keeping Top smooth.


Next, we'll create the sides of our Slot Machine. Duplicate Bottom three times and move them into position so that they form a rectangular prism (see image below). Rename each copy "SideLeft", "SideRight", and "Front". In each instance, set Side's Subdivision Level to 2 while leaving Front at 3.




Now select all six meshes (Cylinder, Top, Bottom, SideLeft, SideRight, Front) and switch over to Object Mode by hitting 5 on your keyboard. In Object Mode, right click on one of the meshes and select Make Group from the popup menu. Repeat this process for each mesh until all six are grouped together. You can tell they are grouped because they will all have small boxes around them in the Outliner window (see image below).


We're now ready to start adding details to our Slot Machine. First, let's add some lights. Create two Point Lights and place them in position as shown in the image below. Name one light "Light1" and name the other light "Light2".


In order for our lights to cast shadows on our Slot Machine, we need to add a Shadow Catcher node to our scene. Select Create -> Nodes -> Shadow Catcher from Maya's main menu bar. With Shadow Catcher selected, go to its Attribute Editor and change Blend Type from None to Multiply. This will cause Light1 and Light2's shadows to be cast onto Shadow Catcher rather than onto nothingness (see image below).




Now let's start adding some textures! We'll be using four textures in total: one for each side of our Slot Machine as well as one for the front panel. The first texture we'll add is for SideLeft. Select Create -> Texture -> UV Coordinate Paint from Maya's main menu bar. With UV Coordinate Paint selected, go to its Attribute Editor and change Width/Height Padding from 1 cm to 0 cm (zero centimeters). This will cause UV Coordinate Paint to paint TexCoords directly onto our mesh instead of creating temporary textures (see image below).

 
To begin painting our texture onto SideLeft, select View -> Show Texture Mask from Maya's main menu bar or press Tab key twice . This puts Maya into Texture Painting mode which allows us to paint textures directly onto our mesh (see image below).

 
Select default brush from toolbar then Begin painting black color over entire side of mesh (except where indicated by red arrow) . Once you're finished painting black color over entire side of mesh , switch over brush color & paint white color over areas where you want highlights . For example , I painted white color over areas shown by red circles in image below . You can also paint other colors if desired .

  After you've finished painting highlights , select File -> Save As from Maya's main menu bar & save your texture somewhere on your computer . I saved my texture as "SlotMachine_SideLeft_01" . Click OK button when Save As window pops up .

 
Repeat these same steps for SideRight , Front , & Back textures . When you're finished , your textures should look something like this :

#  How to Create the Slot Machine in Maya 2016

In this tutorial, we will create the slot machine in Maya 2016. We will use the following tools:

Create a plane

NURBS Circle

Extrude NURBS circle

Scale NURBS circle

Rotate NURBS circle

Select and delete history

Duplicate polygons

Tools > Options > Polygons > Shade Smooth

1. Create a plane

   In Maya, go to Create > Polygon Primitives > Plane. Drag the mouse to create a plane. You can also enter the following values in the command line: plane -w 4 -h 4 -unit length





	2. Convert the plane to a NURBS curve

2.1. With the plane selected, go to Modify > Convert > To Nurbs Curve. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + Shift + C keys on your keyboard to open the Convert menu and then select To Nurbs Curve from the list.

2.2. The edges of the plane will turn into curves. You can see that by default Maya has created three control points for each edge of our plane. We don't need all these control points, so let's delete some of them.

2.3 With the Select tool (), click on one of the control points and drag it away from the plane until you see a minus sign (-) displayed beside it (). This means that Maya has now converted that control point to a vertex (remember that vertices are used to create polygon faces). Do this for all but three of the control points (i.e., delete all but nine of the control points). When you're finished, your curve should look something like this:

3. Create a NURBS Circle

   Now let's create our circular slot machine wheel using a NURBS Circle object. Go to Create > NURBS Primitives > Circle and drag the mouse on screen to create a circle or enter the following values in the command line:circle -r 3 -unit radius

3.1 Scale and Rotate the Circle
3.1.1 With the Circle selected, go to Edit > Transform Type-in Panel or press Ctrl + T keys on your keyboard to open the Transformation Panel and enter 100 for both X and Y scale values so that our circle becomes larger: 
3.1.2 Next, go to Edit > Rotate panel or press Ctrl + R keys on your keyboard to open the Rotate Panel and rotate our circle by 90 degrees so it is perpendicular to our plane: 
4. Extrude and Scale our Circle 4 times
4.1 Now let's extrude our circle four times using edit>extrude menu or pressing E key on your keyboard with different settings each time . For first extrusion : height = 2 , width = 1 , cap type = beveled end . For second extrusion : height = 2 , width = 2 .5 , cap type = round . For third extrusion : height = 3 , width = 1 .5 , cap type = round . And for fourth extrusion : height = 1 .75 , width = 1 .25 , cap type = none :

#  Maya 2016 Tips: How to Make the Slot Machine Eliot


There are a few ways to make the Slot Machine in Maya 2016, but this is the easiest way if you have an object you want to use as the lever.

1. Choose Create > NURBS Primitives > Cylinder. In the Top viewport, create a small cylinder.
2. With the cylinder still selected, choose Modify > Convert to Polygon Mesh.
3. Change the number of sides to 96 in the Subdivisions panel of the Polygons menu.
4. With the mesh still selected, choose Edit > Copy.
5. Activate the Front viewport and choose Edit > Paste Special > Paste in Place. The mesh should appear in the same location as the original cylinder.
6. Select and delete the original cylinder.
7. In the Side viewport, change the pivot point for the mesh to 0,0,0 by choosing Modify > Transform > Pivot Point > Set Center .
8. Choose Create > Deformers > Morpher . In the Morpher options rollout, enable Freeze . This will keep our mesh from moving when we deform it later on. 

  Now let's create our slot machine lever mesh: 
9. Activate the Top viewport and choose Create > Polygon Primitives > Cube .
10. Change the number of sides to 16 in the Subdivisions panel of the Polygons menu . 
11. With the cube still selected, choose Edit > Copy .
12. Activate the Front viewport and choose Edit>Paste Special>Paste in Place . The cube should appear in front of our slot machine mesh. 
13. Resize and rotate (using transform gizmos)the cube until it looks like a lever handle.( You may need to disable Freeze for this step )  14Now we'll apply our deformers: 
15In both viewsports , select both meshes -the slot machine and lever- and drag them onto the Morpher deformer in Object mode . Maya will create an instance of Morpher between them (you can delete this later). The Morpher deformer appears as a small yellow box with red handles around it when selected (if you don't see it make sure that Show Deformation Chains is enabled under Display Options ). If you select just one of these meshes while they're still grouped together Maya will only deform that oneMesh). 

We're going to use a handy shortcut to adjust our levers position:  16With both meshes still selected, hold down Shift+S and click near one ofthe red handles on top of Morpher (this will activate local rotation ). Now you can rotate just that handle without rotatingthe entire deformer -handy for precise positioning! You can also use other Transformation tools (such as Scale or Move ) while Shift+S is active, but be careful not to move or scalethe meshes themselves -you want to affect onlythe deformer handles . When you're finished adjusting your levers position, release Shift+S .
