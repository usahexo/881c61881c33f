If you're a fan of casino games, there's a good chance you've heard of LeoVegas. This online casino is known for its wide selection of games, as well as its generous bonuses and promotions.

One promotion that's particularly popular is the casino's welcome bonus. When you sign up and make your first deposit, LeoVegas will match it with a bonus of up to €400. In addition, you'll also get 20 free spins on one of the casino's most popular slots games, Starburst.

But the best part about LeoVegas is that it doesn't just offer new players bonuses. There are plenty of other promotions available too, including free spins, cashback bonuses, and more. So no matter what type of player you are, you're sure to find a promotion that suits you.

Of course, one thing that always comes with bonuses is terms and conditions. It's important to read these carefully before accepting any bonus, as they can often include wagering requirements. This means that you'll need to playthrough the bonus amount a certain number of times before you can withdraw any winnings.

However, at LeoVegas Casino, the wagering requirements are usually pretty reasonable. For example, the wagering requirement for the welcome bonus is just 35x the bonus amount.

# Choose the Right Games

# Keep Your Cool

One of the biggest mistakes players can make is getting too emotional about their bets.

But this is exactly what you should avoid doing if you want to stay in the black. So try to stay calm and rational when betting, and only bet what you can afford to lose.
