#  Blackjack Dealer Charged with Bilking Casino Out of $100,000

A blackjack dealer at the Foxwoods Resort Casino has been charged with bilking the casino out of more than $100,000. According to police, the dealer, who has not been identified, worked with a group of three accomplices to cheat the casino out of money.

The scheme involved the dealer deliberately miscounting cards in favor of the accomplices. This allowed them to win large sums of money while playing blackjack. The accomplices would then place their bets on the table, relying on the dealer to help them win.

Investigators say that the scheme went on for several months before it was finally discovered. The dealer and his accomplices were able to steal more than $100,000 from the casino before they were caught.

All four suspects have been charged with larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny. They are all scheduled to appear in court later this month.

#  Casino Employee Accused of Cheating Customers Out of Handfuls of Cash

A casino employee in Reno, Nevada stands accused of cheating customers out of their hard-earned cash. The woman is alleged to have stolen money from players by reaching into their gaming hands and grabbing handfuls of cash.

The incident took place on Saturday night, when the employee is said to have grabbed $100 bills from four different players. One victim said that the woman reached into her hand and took $40 right out of it.

Las Vegas based security consultant Russ Heimerich said that the cheating tactic is not new, but is still quite rare. "It's definitely not a common thing, but it does happen from time to time," he told local reporters.

Nevada Gaming Control Board spokesman Eric Johnston added that such incidents are taken very seriously. "This type of behavior is not tolerated in the gaming industry," he said. "If substantiated, the employee will be subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination."

In response to the allegations, the casino issued a statement saying that it was cooperating with investigators and would take appropriate action if warranted.

#  Man Arrested for Swindling Casino Out of $25,000 in Blackjack Hands

On Monday, a man was arrested at the Casino du Lac-Leamy after he was caught cheating the casino out of $25,000 during blackjack games.

The accused, a 44-year-old man from Gatineau, had been playing blackjack at the casino since Friday. On Monday, casino security noticed that the man was using an unusual strategy to win hands. They later determined that he had been using a device to discreetly alter the outcome of the cards he was dealt.

After being caught cheating, the man was arrested and faces criminal charges for fraud. He is currently in police custody and is expected to appear in court at a later date.

This is not the first time that someone has been caught cheating at a casino in Quebec. In 2016, another man was arrested for using hidden devices to cheat casinos out of more than $200,000.

Casinos are known for being particularly vigilant against cheaters, and anyone caught cheating can face serious penalties. So if you're thinking about trying to scam the casino, it's important to know that you could end up behind bars.

#  Blackjack Heist Nets Las Vegas Casino $50,000

The Bellagio Resort and Casino in Las Vegas was the victim of a blackjack heist last week as two men successfully stole $50,000 from the casino.

According to reports, the men were able to exploit a flaw in the casino's security system that allowed them to play blackjack at an advantage. Security officials believe that the men were able to gain access to a control room that gave them access to information about the cards that were being dealt.

The men were eventually caught by casino security, but not before they had managed to walk away with $50,000 in winnings. Casino officials say that they are still investigating how the men were able to exploit the security flaw and are vowing to make changes to ensure that it does not happen again.

Blackjack is a popular casino game that involves betting against the house on the outcome of cards drawn from a deck. In most cases, players are limited to betting no more than half of their chips at any given time.

 casinos have long been a target for cheats and scammers, who often use sophisticated methods to try and take advantage of the house. In recent years, online casinos have become increasingly popular, and with that has come an increase in cheating and scamming activities.

One of the most common methods used by cheats is known as card counting. Card counting involves keeping track of which cards have already been played so that you can make better informed decisions about when to bet and when to fold. By keeping track of which cards are left in the deck, card counters can give themselves an edge over the house by betting when they know that there is a higher chance of getting a good hand.

While card counting is not illegal, casinos do not typically look fondly upon it. Many casinos will eject players who are caught counting cards or will refuse to let them gamble any further. Some casinos even have policies in place that prohibit players from sitting at tables where the odds are in favor of the house.
