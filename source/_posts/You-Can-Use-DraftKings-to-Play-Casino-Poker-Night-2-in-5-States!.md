According to a report, poker night 2 is all set to release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 27th, 2017. The game is already available for pre-order in the Microsoft Store and the PlayStation Store at a price of $29.99. The game is also now available for pre-load on both the platforms.

There are reports that claim that the game has been rated by PEGI as appropriate for players aged 16 and older only. The game developers have not released any information about the plot or gameplay of poker night 2 as yet.

However, it can be safely assumed that like the first installment in the series, poker night 2 will be a casino poker game in which players can play against AI opponents. The game will most likely feature characters from popular franchises such as Borderlands and Portal.

In addition, it has also been rumored that Valve Corporation may have some involvement in this title, judging by the logo of the company that appears in the trailer for the game. In any case, fans of casino poker games are definitely in for a treat once this title is released later this month.

In light of the impending release of poker night 2, we take a look at five states in which you can use your DraftKings account to participate in real money poker tournaments:

1) New York: In New York, online poker is officially legal and regulated under New York State law. This means that you can use your DraftKings account to participate in real money tournaments hosted by licensed and regulated operators within the state borders.

2) Nevada: Nevada was one of the first states in America to legalize online gambling, and as such offers a wide range of legal online gaming options including casino games, poker, and sports betting. You can use your DraftKings account to participate in real money tournaments hosted by licensed operators within Nevada state borders.

3) Delaware: Delaware was another of America's early adopters of online gambling legislation, legalizing a range of casino games including slots, blackjack, Roulette, and video poker way back in 2010. As with Nevada and New York, you can use your DraftKings account to participate in real money tournaments hosted by licensed Delaware online casinos.

4) Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania became the fourth US state to legalize online gambling when legislation was passed there in October 2017. This means that residents of Pennsylvania can now use their DraftKings accounts to participate in real money casino games and poker tournaments offered by licensed operators within state borders.
