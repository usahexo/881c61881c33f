# When will Terre Haute Gambling Establishment open Classic Multi-Hand Blackjack (Red) Game? 

One of the most popular casino games, blackjack, has a new variant that is coming soon to Terre Haute gambling establishments. The Red classic multi-hand blackjack game will offer players the opportunity to bet on up to five hands simultaneously. This exciting new game is expected to open in the fall of 2018.

Blackjack is a simple game to learn but can be complex to play. The object of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (a blackjack), or by having a total point value that is higher than the dealer's total without going over 21. In classic blackjack, you are playing against the dealer only. With multi-hand blackjack, you are playing against the dealer as well as up to four other players.

The Red classic multi-hand blackjack game offers several advantages over traditional blackjack. One obvious advantage is that you have more chances to win. With five hands available to bet on, your odds of winning increase significantly. Additionally, this game offers some great bonus features including a side bet option which pays out based on your hand total.

If you're looking for an exciting and challenging new game to play, be sure to check out the Red classic multi-hand blackjack game when it arrives at Terre Haute gambling establishments this fall!
