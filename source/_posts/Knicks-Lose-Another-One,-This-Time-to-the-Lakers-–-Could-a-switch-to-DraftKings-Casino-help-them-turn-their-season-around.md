#  Knicks Lose Another One, This Time to the Lakers – Could a switch to DraftKings Casino help them turn their season around?

The Knicks have been struggling this season and last night was another example, as they lost to the Lakers. This makes it six losses in their last seven games and puts their record at 10-27.

There has been a lot of speculation about what the Knicks could do to turn their season around. Some have suggested that they make a switch to DraftKings Casino . This could help them improve their performance, as they would have access to better quality gaming options.

In particular, the DraftKings Casino bonus could be a big help. This bonus offers players up to $1000 in free bets, which could give the Knicks the boost they need to start winning games.

#  Patriots Win AFC Championship in Dramatic Fashion After Late Comeback vs Texans – Could they make it all the way to the Super Bowl this year?

The New England Patriots were able to pull off a 27-20 comeback victory against the Houston Texans in the AFC Championship game, thanks to two late touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The first touchdown was scored by Rex Burkhead with just over two minutes remaining, and then Tom Brady sealed the victory with a touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski with less than a minute left. This was the Patriots’ seventh consecutive appearance in the AFC Championship game, and their third consecutive trip to the Super Bowl.

Many observers believed that this would be an easy win for the Patriots, as they were heavily favored going into the game. However, the Texans gave them a good fight, and it was not until late in the fourth quarter that New England was finally able to pull away. In particular, the Texans’ defense played very well in the first half, keeping New England from scoring a single point until late in the second quarter.

The Patriots will now face off against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII on February 4th. This will be a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX, which was won by New England 24-21. The Eagles have had an amazing season so far, and many people are expecting them to give the Patriots a tough battle. However, if Brady and Belichick can pull off another dramatic comeback victory like they did against the Texans, then anything is possible.

#  Curry and Warriors Cruise to Victory Over LeBron and the Cavs – Will we see another rematch in this year's Finals?

The Warriors beat the Cavs 126-91 last night in a game that was not as close as the score would indicate. Stephen Curry led all scorers with 38 points and KD pitched in 32 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists. LeBron James had 28 points on 11-of-20 shooting but Kyrie Irving only scored 11 points on 4-of-14 shooting.

This was the third consecutive victory for the Warriors over the Cavs this season, and it is now quite clear that Cleveland is not in the same league as Golden State. The question now is whether we will see another rematch in this year's Finals.

The Warriors are clearly the best team in the NBA right now, with a record of 57-14. They have looked unstoppable lately, winning their last 10 games by an average of 19 points per game. The Cavaliers, on the other hand, have been struggling lately, losing six of their last 10 games.

Even if Cleveland does manage to make it to the Finals, they will most likely be no match for Golden State. The Warriors have too many weapons for LeBron James to handle, and they are just too deep and talented to be beaten by anyone other than the Spurs or Cavaliers.

#  Cowboys Shock the World, Defeat Packers in Overtime – Can America's Team keep up this momentum for the rest of the season?

In a stunning upset, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Green Bay Packers in overtime this past Sunday. This was a much-needed victory for the Cowboys, who were coming into the game with a 2-3 record.

The Cowboys were able to come back from a 14-point deficit in the 4th quarter to force overtime. In overtime, Dak Prescott completed a clutch pass to Amari Cooper to set up the game-winning field goal.

This victory was especially impressive because it came against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers. Rodgers is considered one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history, and he had not lost an overtime game in his career until this matchup against Dallas.

The Cowboys will look to build on this momentum as they head into their next game against the Houston Texans. It will be interesting to see if they can sustain their success throughout the rest of the season.
