#  What is the best way to use a coat hanger?

There are many different ways that a coat hanger can be used, but some ways are more effective than others.

When using a coat hanger to organize a closet, it is best to hang clothes on the curved part of the hanger. This will help to keep the clothing from becoming misshapen. Additionally, if there is a lot of clothing to be organized, it might be helpful to use more than one coat hanger.

If there is no closet available, or if there is not enough space for all of the clothes to be hung up, then another way to use a coat hanger is to create a makeshift shelf. By bending the coat hanger into a U-shape and placing it on a wall, it can be used as a place to hang purses, belts, or other accessories.

Finally, if there is an item of clothing that does not fit well or that needs to be aired out, then it can be placed on a coat hanger. This will help to keep the item from getting wrinkled and will allow it to air out properly.

- Don't use a wire coat hanger - these can leave impressions in the fabric.

- Don't use a metal coat hanger - these can snag and tear delicate fabrics.

- Use a padded or plastic coat hanger instead.

#  How do you store a coat hanger?
